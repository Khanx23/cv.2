        <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
        <p>I always had a knack for design and loved looking at good design, so I told myself why not try to learn it. Through design I got into web development as well as other adobe apps. One of the best decisions in my life Alhamdulilah!</p>

        <h3>Basketball</h3>
        <p>Basketball is therapy for me, and I can honestly say without that game I'm not the person I am today #BallHaiZindagi</p>

        <h3>Muhammad Ali</h3>
        <p>Muhammad Ali was a blessing to this world, the fact that Allah made the name Muhammad on the tip of every tongue through him in this world is beyond a miracle.</p>

        <h3>Lebron James</h3>
        <p>What LeBron showed me is that mistakes are necessary for success, and having no fear no matter what is the way to live. LeBron is hated and loved on the court but outside of the court what he has done for basketball culture, and being
          more than an athlete speaks volumes.</p>

        <h3>Malcom X</h3>
        <p>Malcom X changed America, he showed America an outside perpective of what he experienced in the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca called Hajj. He said "During the past eleven days here in the Muslim world, I have eaten from the same plate, drunk
          from the same glass and slept in the same bed while praying to the same God with fellow Muslims, whose eyes were the bluest of the blue, whose hair was the blondest of blond, and whose skin was the whitest of white. And in the words and in
          the actions and in the deeds of the white Muslims, I felt the same sincerity that I felt among the black African Muslims of Nigeria, Sudan and Ghana. We are truly all the same-brothers. All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

        <h3>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h3>
        <p>One of the pioneers of athletes taking advantage of their voice and having an impact outside of basketball. Kareem had social awareness and invloved himself in activism and spoke up on political issues. 50 years ago, he boycotted the 1968
          Summer Olympics in a protest for civil rights & social justice. He was a forebearer to the modern athlete activist, a role now played by Lebron James, Colin Kaepernick & others. For his efforts he was awarded the Medal of Freedom by Obama
          in 2016.</p>

        <h3>The Final Prophet Muhammad, Peace be Upon Him</h3>
        <p>Not only was he the greatest man to ever walk earth, he was the best example to follow and live life following his teachings. He was a man of character his honesty and trustworthy nature surpassed all others, to the point his enemies trusted him more than anyone. He was gentle and forgiving, his enemies would humilate him, abuse him, and speak bad about him, his only reaction was to pray for them. He is the way to the truth and his way should be the way we act in this day and age.</p>

      <h2>My Favorite Quote</h2>
      <p> It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If we take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole.<p>
